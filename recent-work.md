# Recent Work

## Scientific Publications

These are works I've led:
- [A shake and a surge: Assessing the possibility of an earthquake-triggered eruption at Steamboat Geyser](https://doi.org/10.30909/vol.07.02.733748) (2024, *Volcanica*)
  - Big earthquakes near and far affect geyser activity. But what about small earthquakes?
  - This is a blueprint for how to investigate whether an earthquake triggered a geyser eruption. Spoiler alert: permanent seismic monitoring stations provide crucial data.
- [Snow suppresses seismic signals at Steamboat Geyser](https://doi.org/10.1029/2023GL103904) (2023, *Geophysical Research Letters*)
  - Who doesn't love an alliterative title? Steamboat's eruptions are noisy, and a nearby seismometer mostly picks up sound waves traveling from the air *into* the ground rather than seismic waves traveling *only* through the ground.
  - Snow significantly reduces the amount of energy transmitted into the ground from the sound waves. This impacts interpretation of eruption intensity and might also be relevant at snow-covered volcanoes.
- [The 2018 reawakening and eruption dynamics of Steamboat Geyser, the world’s tallest active geyser](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2020943118) (2021, *PNAS*)
  - Your starting point for understanding the first few years of the latest active phase of Steamboat Geyser.
  - Why did it reactivate after a few decades of relative dormancy? We're still not sure... :(
  - ...but we ruled a few things out like earthquakes and anomalous precipitation. :)

## General Audience Publications

Occasionally, I write about geysers for the [*Yellowstone Caldera Chronicles*](https://www.usgs.gov/volcanoes/yellowstone/caldera-chronicles), a weekly column published by the U.S. Geological Survey. This is a great resource for anyone looking to learn about Yellowstone-related earth science topics. I contributed to these columns:
- [Digging into the history of hydrothermal explosions in Biscuit Basin](https://www.usgs.gov/observatories/yvo/news/digging-history-hydrothermal-explosions-biscuit-basin)
- [New research sheds light on Steamboat Geyser’s eruptions, past and present](https://www.usgs.gov/observatories/yvo/news/new-research-sheds-light-steamboat-geysers-eruptions-past-and-present)
- [Insights into the eruptions of Steamboat Geyser](https://www.usgs.gov/observatories/yvo/news/insights-eruptions-steamboat-geyser)

## In News Media
Science journalists rock. Here are cool stories featuring research I've been involved in:

## In Podcasts
I said some words for a few podcast episodes:
- *Hello, Nature* episode 5: [Hello, Yellowstone](https://hello-nature.simplecast.com/episodes/ep-5-hello-yellowstone-EU93Myza)
- *PNAS Science Sessions*: [Eruption of Steamboat Geyser](https://www.pnas.org/post/podcast/eruption-steamboat-geyser)
