## Welcome to the website of Mara H. Reed, your friendly hydrothermal zealot.
Mara is a graduate student in the Earth and Planetary Science Department at the University of California, Berkeley. Her research interests include the influences on geyser eruption intervals, hydrothermal monitoring, and citizen science. She also provides scientific guidance for [GeyserTimes](https://www.geysertimes.org), a crowdsourced database of geyser eruptions.

In her free time, Mara heads underground with cavers from the Diablo Grotto, pursues nature photography, and complains about the lack of snow in the Bay Area.
