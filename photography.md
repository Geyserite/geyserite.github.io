Photography has always been a hobby of mine, but I really started to get into the technical details when I began taking my camera underground on cave trips. The adage "use the available light" still holds, but *you* get to create it all. My camera always stays in my pack while hiking and whenever I'm around geysers (for research or for leisure).
